The dashboard shall feature:  

* Picture of specific survey site (provided by client) 
* Description of the specific survey site.  Users can toggle views between Filipino and English.  (Both texts provided by client) 
* Graph of commercial fish biomass since 2017 at a specific site.  (Note: There may be periods of no scientific monitoring, such as during covid19. Here, the preferred solution is a dotted straight line connecting the dots (on either side of the data gap).  Additionally, the user should be able to select to compare the graph side by side to nothing (default, option 1), any other specific site (option 2) or the average of all other sites. (Option 3). The graph must dynamically scale to device, but also scale to allow for future date data entry. 
* Graph of hard coral cover since 2017 at a specific site.  (Note: There may be periods of no scientific monitoring, such as during covid19. Here a dotted straight-line connecting the dots (on either side of the data gap) is the preferred solution.  Additionally, the user should be able to select to compare the graph side by side to nothing (default, option 1), any other specific site (option 2) or the average of all other sites. (Option 3).  The graph must dynamically scale to device, but also scale to allow for future date data entry. 
* Graph of fish average length since 2017 at specific sites.  (Note: There may be periods of no scientific monitoring, such as during covid19. Here a dotted straight-line connecting the dots (on either side of the data gap) is the preferred solution.  The user should be able to select fish species. Additionally, the user should be able to select to compare the graph side by side to nothing (default, option 1), any other specific fish/specific site (option 2) or the average of specific fish of all other sites. (Option 3)  The graph must dynamically scale to device, but also scale to allow for future date data entry. 
* Eco-Tourism information at specific site. All charismatic species listed on Y axis, and bars along X axis showing EITHER observation success (observed=yes) on % of surveys (default). OR average numeric observation # per survey.  Data to be used: Current date and 365 days previous. (Only for surveys with charismatic species observations; other surveys disregarded) The user should be able to select % or numeric, with units on the X axis changing.  
    * Additionally, the user should be able to select to compare the bar graph side by side to nothing (default, option 1), same site in previous years (option 2) or the average of charismatic species of all other sites for the same period. (Option 3).    The graph must dynamically scale to device, but also scale to allow for future date data entry.
